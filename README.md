Third Semester on Wroclaw University of Technology

*"A bit of theory, a bit of C, a bit of Bash*

*But makes you crunch at night until your crash"*

## What's inside (in a nutshell)

1. Problem Set
    - Isn't there cause it's just theory about bios/uefi/gpt/mbr/partitions/kalilinux/vbox/ubuntu...
    - ... and some more about the scrapyard that heats my dorm room if I will turn on Witcher 3 on High.
2. Problem Set
    - All Console Colors Printer
    - Script that turns everything to lowercase in a catalog
3. Problem Set
    - System Info script
    - Own Variation of unix ps
    - Script using Rest Api to read chuck norris json and printing a cat
    - Script that watch a site and archives it if any change was detected
4. Problem Set
    - Script that any user can run to open admin console w/o password
    - Signals Theory Stuff with programs to prove it
    - Own variation of unix shell
5. Problem Set
    - Own implementation of printf w/o use of libs and macros (like va_start, va_arg and va_end) [32bit]
    - Multihread matrix multiplication of two random matrixs
    - Minitalk (server-client messenger w/o using threads and forks with simple login and private messages)
    - Matrix multiplication and optimalization of that proces
    - Creation of FAT and VFAT and then theory and then recover deleted files manually (theory)
6. Problem Set
    - Asm program for proc6502that prints 8-bit number in hex
    - Asm program that looks up for primes in bounds from 1 to 10000
    - Asm program that calculates simple stuff and prints it
    - Asm program that that counts n! on 128bits
    - Asm program that draws Mandelbrot set
