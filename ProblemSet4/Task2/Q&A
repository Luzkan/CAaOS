1. No - 9) SIGKILL makes it impossible. (2a.c)
2. sudo kill -9 1 ---> well

	By default root can't kill PID 1

	The only signals that can be sent to process ID 1, the init process, are
	those for which init has explicitly installed signal handlers.
	This is done to assure the system is not brought down accidentally.
